# Thesis Title:
## Understanding of dynamical system by Time Series Analysis

## Summary:
- Simulated and analyzed chaotic behavior in atmospheric systems using the Lorenz model.
- Generated multiple datasets in MATLAB to construct 2D and 3D phase plots, revealing the systemâ€™s structural dynamics.
- Distinguished chaotic from random signals by computing autocorrelation functions and correlation dimension.
- Confirmed the presence of deterministic chaos and identified a minimum embedding dimension of three for accurate phase space reconstruction.
